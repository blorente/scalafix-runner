# Scalafix batch runner

A set of utilities to run the same scalafix rule in several sbt projects.

## Contents

The main functionality is in the folder `utils`, which consists on a set of scripts to handle project import and configuration, as well as running scalafix rules. Run `utils/<script name>.sh -h` to see the usage of a script.

**NOTE:** All of the scripts have to be run _from the root of the repo_ for now.
